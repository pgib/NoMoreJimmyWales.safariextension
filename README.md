No More Jimmy Wales
===================

A friend was saying he's about to never return to Wikipedia because he's tired of seeing Jimmy Wales on every page, so I whipped up this Safari Extension in 10 minutes. It consists of a stylesheet to hide the container in which Jimmy Wales appears, and applies to *.wikipedia.org.
